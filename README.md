This project was built as a sandbox to explore vehicle physics, spline-based navigation, and AI driving logic using Unreal Engine C++. It is not meant to be a finished game or product. Instead, it focuses on learning, experimenting, and building a strong technical foundation for future game projects.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Model realistic driving behavior and physical parameters  
- Implement spline-based auto-navigation for vehicle bots  
- Create a basic AI system for overtaking and lane adjustment  
- Manage collision recovery and stabilize car physics mid-race

---

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- Drag coefficients, gear ratios, and center of mass tuning for realistic physics  
- Spline tracking and look-ahead targeting for smooth navigation  
- AI overtaking decisions with cooldown logic to mimic human-like behavior  
- Corrective physics responses including roll, pitch, and vertical damping to stabilize the car during dynamic situations

## 📒 Developer Note

> This project does not aim for commercial success; it is a growth-oriented endeavor focused on learning and exploration.  
> Some parts of the code may be non-functional due to ongoing experimentation and transitions between different approaches.  
> My goal is to deepen my knowledge of Unreal Engine and enhance the quality of my future projects through continuous practice.
