\# MyProject Sports Car — Unreal Engine C++ Practice Project 🏎️🧪



This project was built as a sandbox to explore vehicle physics, spline-based navigation, and AI driving logic using Unreal Engine C++. It is not meant to be a finished game or product. Instead, it focuses on learning, experimenting, and building a strong technical foundation for future game projects.



\## 🎯 Project Goals

\- Model realistic driving behavior and physical parameters  

\- Implement spline-based auto-navigation for vehicle bots  

\- Create a basic AI system for overtaking and lane adjustment  

\- Manage collision recovery and stabilize car physics mid-race



\## 🔧 Technical Highlights

\- Drag coefficients, gear ratios, center of mass tuning  

\- Spline tracking and look-ahead targeting  

\- AI overtaking decisions with cooldown logic  

\- Corrective physics responses (roll, pitch, vertical damping)



\## 📒 Developer Note

> This project does not aim for success it is a growth-oriented endeavor.  

> Some parts of the code may be non-functional due to transitions between different approaches over time.  

> My goal is to learn Unreal Engine and improve the quality of my future projects.
