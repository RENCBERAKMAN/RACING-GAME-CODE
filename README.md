This project was built as a sandbox to explore vehicle physics, spline-based navigation, and AI driving logic using Unreal Engine C++. It is not meant to be a finished game or product. Instead, it focuses on learning, experimenting, and building a strong technical foundation for future game projects.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Model realistic driving behavior and physical parameters  
- Implement spline-based auto-navigation for vehicle bots  
- Create a basic AI system for overtaking and lane adjustment  
- Manage collision recovery and stabilize car physics mid-race

---

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- Drag coefficients, gear ratios, center of mass tuning  
- Spline tracking and look-ahead targeting  
- AI overtaking decisions with cooldown logic  
- Corrective physics responses (roll, pitch, vertical damping)

## 📒 Developer Note

> This project does not aim for success it is a growth-oriented endeavor.  
> Some parts of the code may be non-functional due to transitions between different approaches over time.  
> My goal is to learn Unreal Engine and improve the quality of my future projects.
